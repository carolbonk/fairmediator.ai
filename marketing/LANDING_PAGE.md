**💸 Wasted Money**

## FAQ Section

### Headline
**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: How accurate is the conflict detection?**
A: Our algorithm analyzes 4 verified data sources (FEC, Senate LDA, RECAP, LinkedIn). We detect 40% more conflicts than manual searches because we cross-reference multiple databases simultaneously.

**Q: Is this legal?**
A: Yes. All data comes from public government databases (FEC, Senate LDA, PACER). We don't scrape LinkedIn or violate any terms of service.

**Q: Do you notify mediators that they're being checked?**
A: No. Your searches are completely confidential. Mediators never know they're being vetted.

**Q: What if I find a conflict?**
A: Use our findings to request mediator recusal or select an alternative. For high-stakes cases, order a Human-Verified Dossier ($500-3K) with full citations for court submission.

**Q: How long does a conflict check take?**
A: 30 seconds on average. Batch checks (50+ mediators) take 2-3 minutes total.

**Q: What if the mediator isn't in your database?**
A: We automatically search federal databases in real-time. If no data exists, we show "No Records Found" (which is useful information—it means no federal conflicts).

**Q: Can I export results?**
A: Yes (Premium plan). Export CSV with all conflict details, risk scores, and data sources.

**Q: Do you cover state-level data?**
A: Federal data only (covers 80% of conflicts). State data coming Q3 2026.
