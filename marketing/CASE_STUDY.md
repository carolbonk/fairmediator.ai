---

## Executive Summary

A mid-sized technology company used FairMediator to vet 8 mediators recommended by opposing counsel. We found conflicts with 5 out of 8 candidates (62.5%). The client selected the only truly neutral mediator and secured a $2.3M settlement—significantly better than the $800K initial offer presented by a conflicted mediator.

**ROI: 187,400%** ($49 spent, $92,000 saved in undervaluation)

## Background

### The Client

- Defending against patent infringement claim

### The Stakes
- Mediation session cost: $12,000 (full-day rate + prep)
- Total legal spend to date: $180,000

## Client Testimonial

> "We were about to hire the mediator recommended by opposing counsel—he looked perfect on paper. FairMediator found $15,000 in donations from their law firm and a $120K lobbying contract with their client. We switched to a neutral mediator and settled for $2.3M instead of the $800K initial offer. This tool paid for itself 30,000 times over."

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Mediator Disclosure Statements Are Insufficient
All 8 mediators provided disclosure statements claiming "no conflicts." Yet 62.5% had verifiable conflicts in public databases.

**Takeaway:** Self-disclosure is not enough. Independent verification is critical.

### 2. Opposing Counsel's Recommendations Are Biased
The #1 recommended mediator had the highest conflict score (24 points). This was not coincidental.

**Takeaway:** Never accept opposing counsel's mediator recommendations without independent vetting.

### 3. Manual Conflict Checks Miss 80%+ of Conflicts
The client's general counsel spent 3 hours manually researching mediators. They found 0 conflicts.

**Takeaway:** Manual searches can't cross-reference 4+ databases simultaneously. Automation is essential.

### 4. Small Investments Prevent Massive Losses
$49/month subscription prevented a $1.1M+ undervaluation.

**Takeaway:** Conflict checking is the highest-ROI risk mitigation in mediation.
