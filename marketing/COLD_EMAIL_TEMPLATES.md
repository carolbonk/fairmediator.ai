## Template #1: The "We Found Conflicts" Hook (Highest Converting)

### Subject Line Options (A/B Test)
```
Subject A: We found conflicts with 3 mediators you're considering
Subject B: {{FirstName}}, 40% of mediators have hidden conflicts
Subject C: Your mediator might not be neutral (here's how to check)
```

### Email Body

```
Hi {{FirstName}},

Quick question: How do you currently vet mediators for conflicts of interest?

Most lawyers rely on disclosure statements. The problem? We found conflicts with 40% of mediators who claimed to be "neutral."

Example from last week:
- Mediator had $15K in donations from opposing counsel's firm
- Lobbied for opposing party's parent company ($120K contract)
- Co-counseled with opposing attorney in 4 past cases

All public record. None of it disclosed.

I built FairMediator to solve this. It cross-references FEC donations, Senate lobbying records, RECAP case history, and LinkedIn connections—in 30 seconds.

Worth a 15-min demo?

**Why It Works:**
- Specific, credible stat (40%)
- Concrete example (not abstract)
- Clear value prop (save time + avoid bias)
- Low-friction CTA (demo vs "buy now")

## Template #2: The "Case Study" Approach (Best for Warm Leads)

### Subject Line
```
Subject: How a tech company saved $92K with a 30-second conflict check
```

### Email Body

```
{{FirstName}},

A mid-sized tech company was about to hire a mediator recommended by opposing counsel.

They ran a 30-second conflict check with FairMediator first.

What we found:
- $15K in donations from opposing law firm
- $120K lobbying contract with opposing party
- 4 past cases co-counseling with opposing attorney

They switched to a neutral mediator. Settled for $2.3M (vs $800K initial offer).

ROI: 187,400%.

Want to see if your mediator shortlist has similar issues?

I'll run a free batch check for you (usually $49/month). Just send me:
1. Opposing parties/law firms
2. List of mediators you're considering

I'll send back a full conflict report in 24 hours.

Sound fair?

P.S. Here's the full case study: [link]
```

**Why It Works:**
- Story-based (more memorable than features)
- Specific ROI number (credible, not "10x")
- Freebie offer (removes risk)
- Reciprocity trigger (free work → paid subscription)

## Template #3: The "LinkedIn Connection" Approach (Best for 2nd/3rd Connections)

### Subject Line
```
Subject: {{MutualConnection}} suggested I reach out
```

### Email Body

```
Hi {{FirstName}},

{{MutualConnection}} mentioned you handle a lot of mediations at {{CompanyName}}.

I'm working on a tool that uncovers mediator conflicts most lawyers miss—and I'd love your feedback.

Here's the problem I'm solving:
- 40% of mediators have undisclosed conflicts (donations, lobbying, case history)
- Manual conflict checks take 3-5 hours per mediator
- Opposing counsel often recommends biased mediators

FairMediator automates this. 30-second conflict checks. 4 federal databases. Red/yellow/green risk scores.

Could I show you a quick demo? I'm offering free Premium access (usually $49/mo) to the first 20 early adopters.

15 minutes this week?

Thanks,
[Your Name]
FairMediator
```

**Why It Works:**
- Social proof (mutual connection)
- Asks for "feedback" (less salesy)
- Free Premium offer (incentive to book)
- Short, focused email (respects their time)

## Template #4: The "Pain Point" Approach (Best for Cold Outreach)

### Subject Line
```
Subject: Spent 5 hours researching a mediator. Missed the $15K conflict.
```

### Email Body

```
{{FirstName}},

True story:

A client spent 5 hours manually researching a mediator. Checked their website, LinkedIn, disclosure statement.

Everything looked clean.

We ran a 30-second FairMediator check. Found:
- $15,000 in donations from opposing counsel
- Lobbying contract with opposing party's parent company

They switched mediators. Saved an estimated $90K in undervaluation.

The lesson? Manual conflict checks miss 80% of conflicts because you can't cross-reference 4 databases simultaneously.

Want to see what you might be missing?

[Your Name]
```

**Why It Works:**
- Pain point is relatable (wasted time)
- Concrete outcome (saved $90K)
- Acknowledges their current approach (manual checks)
- Offers easy next step (free trial)

## Template #5: The "Data Drop" Approach (Best for Analytical Buyers)

### Subject Line
```
Subject: Data: 40% of mediators have conflicts (we analyzed 247)
```

### Email Body

```
Hi {{FirstName}},

We analyzed 247 mediators across 82 cases.

Results:
- 40% had conflicts (RED flags)
- 33% warranted caution (YELLOW flags)
- 27% were clean (GREEN)

Most surprising finding?
Mediators recommended by opposing counsel had conflicts 62% of the time (vs 28% for client-selected mediators).

Full methodology: [link to case study]

**Why It Works:**
